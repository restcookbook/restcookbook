<h2 id='welcome_to_the_rest_cookbook'>Welcome to the REST CookBook</h2>

<p>REST is hot! And REST is finally rediscovered by API programmers all over the world. But REST isn't always as easy
    as it seems on first look. Dealing with HATEOAS, Code on demand and uniform interfaces can be really tricky and many
    people will fall back to not-so-restful approaches when things are starting to become more difficult. But it doesn't
    need to be. Once you get to know REST, you will like it.</p>

<p>The RESTful cookbook website is inspired by the <a href="http://www.puppetcookbook.com">puppetcookbook</a> from
    <a href="http://unixdaemon.net">Dean Wilson</a>, who created cookbook recipes on how to deal with some of the
    issues people are facing over and over again when using the Puppet Configuration management tool. This site however,
    is about dealing with issues and questions people are facing over and over again when trying to create RESTful APIs.</p>

<p>This site is created by <a href="https://adayinthelifeof.nl">Joshua Thijssen</a> and is available on
    <a href="http://github.com/restcookbook/restcookbook">github</a>, so you can always add or update information if you
    like. With more contributions, this site can become the place where you can find all answers to your RESTful questions
    once and for all.</p>
