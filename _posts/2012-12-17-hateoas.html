<p class="question">What is HATEOAS and why is it important for my REST API?</p>

<p>HATEOAS stands for <b>Hypertext As The Engine Of Application State</b>. It means that hypertext should be used to
    find your way through the API. An example:</p>

{% highlight xml %}
GET /account/12345 HTTP/1.1

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<account>
    <account_number>12345</account_number>
    <balance currency="usd">100.00</balance>
    <link rel="deposit" href="/account/12345/deposit" />
    <link rel="withdraw" href="/account/12345/withdraw" />
    <link rel="transfer" href="/account/12345/transfer" />
    <link rel="close" href="/account/12345/close" />
</account>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Apart from the fact that we have 100 dollars (US) in our account, we can see have have 4 options: deposit more money,
    withdraw money, transfer money to another account, or close our account. The "link"-tags allows us to find out the
    URLs that are  needed for the specified actions. Now, let's suppose we didn't have 100 usd in the bank, but we
    actually are in the red:</p>

{% highlight xml %}
GET /account/12345 HTTP/1.1

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<account>
    <account_number>12345</account_number>
    <balance currency="usd">-25.00</balance>
    <link rel="desposit" href="/account/12345/desposit" />
</account>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Now we are 25 dollars in the red. Do you see that right now we have lost many of our options, and only depositing
    money is valid? As long as we are in the red, we cannot close our account, nor transfer or withdraw any money from
    the account. The hypertext is actually telling us what is allowed and what not: HATEOAS</p>
