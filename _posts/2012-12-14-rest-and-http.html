<p class="question">Are REST and HTTP the same thing?</p>

<p>No, they are not. HTTP stands for <b>H</b>yper<b>T</b>ext <b>T</b>ransport <b>P</b>rotocol and is a way to transfer
    files. This protocol is used to link pages of hypertext in what we call the world-wide-web. However, there are other
    transfer protocols available, like FTP and gopher, yet they are less popular.
</p>

<p><b>RE</b>presentational <b>S</b>tate <b>T</b>ransfer, or REST, is a set of constraints that ensure a scalable,
    fault-tolerant and easily extendible system. The world-wide-web is an example of such system (and the biggest
    example, one might say). REST by itself is not a new invention, but its the documentation on such systems like the
    world-wide-web.</p>

<p>One thing that confuses people, is that REST and HTTP seem to be hand-in-hand. After all, the world-wide-web itself
    runs on HTTP, and it makes sense, a RESTful API does the same. However, there is nothing in the REST constraints
    that makes the usage of HTTP as a transfer protocol mandatory. It's perfectly possible to use other transfer
    protocols like SNMP, SMTP and others to use, and your API could still very well be a RESTful API</p>

<p>In practice, most - if not all - RESTful APIs currently use HTTP as a transport layer, since the infrastructure,
    servers and client libraries for HTTP are widely available already</p>

<p>Note that there is also a big difference between a RESTful API and a HTTP API. A RESTful API adheres ALL the REST
    constraints set out in its "format" documentation (in the dissertation of Roy Fielding). A HTTP API is ANY API that
    makes use of HTTP as their transfer protocol. This means that even SOAP can be considered a HTTP API, as long as it
    will use HTTP for transport, but most HTTP APIs will make more and better use of the infrastructure and possibilities
    of HTTP. Most HTTP APIs can be very close to becoming a truly RESTful API. This can be defined by their Richardsons
    maturity level.</p>

<h3>Caveats</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Even though it's tempting to create your own pagination scheme by "building" URLs, you should only use the information given by
    the API. This means, you cannot assume that the 3rd page can be found at /collection/3. If you do, your client will brake as soon
    as the API changes its pagination behaviour.</li>
</ul>
