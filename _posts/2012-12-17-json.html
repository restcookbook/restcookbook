<p class="question">Is my API RESTful when I use (only) JSON?</p>

<p>Short anwser: no. Long answer: no, not yet. One of the key constrains on REST is that a RESTful API must use
    hypermedia formats (the HATEOAS constraint). Unfortunately, JSON is not a hypermedia format. There is no predefined
    way to deal with link discovery in JSON. One API could use the following for link discovery:</p>

{% highlight json %}
    {
    "_links" : [
        {
            "rel" : "self"
            "href" : "http://example.org/foo/bar"
        },
        {
            "rel" :
            ...
        }
    ]
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>while another API would use something like this:</p>

{% highlight json %}
    {
    "hyperlink" : [
        "self" : "http://example.org/foo/bar",
        "next" : "http://example.org/foo/bar/2",
    ]
}
{% endhighlight %}


<p>Although JSON isn't hypermedia, some standardisation is on its way to make JSON hypermedia. Two of these, JSON-LD and HAL,
    formalizes these links so any client can instantly follow and discover these links, without any additional knowledge on how this
    has been setup.

<h3>Caveats</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Because there is no standardized way, JSON for APIs can and most probably will result in tight coupling between
        clients and servers. Servers need to know exactly how you provide links in JSON (if at all). Using HAL or JSON-LD can
        reduce this coupling and allow you to formally present (hypermedia) links in your API.
