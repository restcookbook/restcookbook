<p class="question">Is my API RESTfull when I use JSON?</p>

<p>Short anwser: no. Long answer: no, it isn't. One of the key constrains on REST is that a RESTful API must use a
    hypermedia format. Unfortunally, JSON is not a hypermedia format. JSON by itself has no way to deal with link discovery.

{% highlight json %}
    _links
        _rel :
        _link :
        _href :
    {% endhighlight %}

<p>Although JSON isn't hypermedia, some standardisation is on its way to make JSON hypermedia. Two of these, JSON-LD and HAL,
    formalizes these links so any client can instantly follow and discover these links, without any additional knowledge on how this
    has been setup.
