<h2 class="question">What are idempotent and/or safe methods?</h2>

<p>Safe methods are HTTP methods that do not modify resources. For instance, using [GET] or [HEAD] on a resource URL, should
    NEVER change the resource. However, this is not completely true. It means: it won't change the resource representation.
    It is still possible, that safe methods do change things on a server or resource, but this should not reflect in a
    different representation.
</p>

<p>This means the following is incorrect, if this would actually delete the blogpost:</p>
{% highlight xml %}
GET /blog/1234/delete HTTP/1.1
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Safe methods are methods that can be cached, prefetched without any repercussions to the resource.</p>

<h3>Idempotent methods</h3>
<p>An idempotent HTTP method is a HTTP method that can be called many times without different outcomes. It would not
    matter if the method is called only once, or ten times over. The result should be the same. Again, this only applies
    to the result, not the resource itself. This still can be manipulated (like an update-timestamp, provided this
    information is not shared in the (current) resource representation.</p>

<p>Consider the following examples:</p>
{% highlight xml %}
  a = 4;
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight xml %}
  a++;
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The first example is idempotent: no matter how many times we execute this statement, a will always be 4. The second
    example is not idempotent. Executing this 10 times will result in a different outcome as when running 5 times. Since
    both examples are changing the value of a, both are non-safe methods.</p>

<p>Idempotency is important in building a fault-tolerant API. Suppose a client wants to update a resource through [POST].
    Since [POST] is not a idempotent method, calling it multiple times can result in wrong updates. What would happen if
    you sent out the [POST] request to the server, but you get a timeout. Is the resource actually updated? Does the
    timeout happened during sending the request to the server, or the response to the client? Can we safely retry again,
    or do we need to figure out first what has happened with the resource? By using idempotent methods, we do not have
    to answer this question, but we can safely resend the request until we actually get a response back from the server.</p>

<p>Be careful when dealing with safe methods as well: if a seemingly safe method like [GET] will change a resource, it might
    be possible that any middleware client proxy systems between you and the server, will cache this response. Another
    client who wants to change this resource through the same URL (like: http://example.org/api/article/1234/delete), will
    not call the server, but return the information directly from the cache. Non-safe (and non-idempotent) methods will
    never be cached by any middleware proxies</p>
