<p class="question">What is the Richardson Maturity Model?</p>

<p>The Richardson Maturity Model is a way to grade your API according to the REST constraints. The better your API
    adheres these constraints, the higher its score is. The Richardson Maturity Model knows 4 levels (0-3), where level
    3 designates a truly RESTful API.</p>
</p>

<h3>Level 0: Swamp of POX</h3>
<p>Level 0 uses a transport protocol merely for tunneling. No properties of the transfer protocol is used, and all
    work is done through this tunnel. It will use only one entrypoint (URI) and one kind of method (in HTTP, this
    normally is the [POST] method. Examples of these are SOAP and XML-RPC.</p>

<h3>Level 1: Resources</h3>
<p>When your API can distinguish between different resources, it might be level 1. This level uses multiple URIs, where
    where every URI is the entrypoint to a specific resource. Instead of going through http://example.org/articles, you
    actually distinguish between http://example.org/article/1 and http://example.org/article/2. Still, this level uses
    only one single method like [POST].</p>

<h3>Level 2: HTTP verbs</h3>
<p>To be honest, I don't like this level. This is because this level suggests that in order to be truly RESTful, your API
    <b>MUST</b> use HTTP verbs. It doesn't. REST is completely transport agnostic, and if you want to use a different
    transport protocol, you can do so, and your API will still be RESTful.</p>
<p>This level indicates that your API should use the transport protocol properties in order to deal with scalability and
    failures. Don't use a single [POST] method for all, but make use of [GET] when you are requesting resources, and use the
    [DELETE] method when you want to delete a resources. Also, use the response codes of your tunneling protocol. Don't
    use [200] (OK) code when something went wrong for instance. By doing this for the HTTP transport protocol, or any other
    transport protocol you like to use, you have reached level 2.</p>

<h3>Level 3: Hypermedia controls</h3>
<p>Level 3, the highest level, uses HATEOAS to deal with discovering the possibilities of your API towards the clients.
    More information about HATEOAS can be found below.</p>
