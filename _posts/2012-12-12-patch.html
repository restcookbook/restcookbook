<p class="question">When should we use the PATCH HTTP method?</p>

<p>The HTTP methods [PATCH] can be used to update partial resources. For instance, when you only need to update one field of the resource, [PUT]ting a complete resource
representation might be cumbersome and utilizes more bandwidth</p>

{% highlight xml %}
PATCH /user/jthijssen HTTP/1.1
<user>
    <firstname>Joshua</firstname>
</user>
{% endhighlight %}


<p>Also, the [PUT] method is idempotent. [PUT]ting the same data multiple times to the same resource, should not result in different resources,
while [POST]ing to the same resource can result creation of multiple resources.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Caveats</h3>
<ul>
    <li>[PATCH] is neither safe nor idempotent.</li>
    <li>An API implementing [PATCH] must patch atomically. It MUST not be possible that resources are half-patched when requisted by a [GET].</li>
</ul>
