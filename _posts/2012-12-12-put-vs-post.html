<p class="question">When should we use PUT and when should we use POST?</p>

<p>The HTTP methods POST and PUT aren't the HTTP equivalent of the CRUD's create and update. The both serve a different purpose. It's quite possible, valid and
even preferred in some occasions, to use PUT to create resources, or use POST to update resources.</p>

<p>Also, the PUT method is idempotent. PUTting the same data multiple times to the same resource, should not result in different resources,
while POSTing to the same resource can result creation of multiple resources.</p>

<h3>Caveats</h3>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>PUT and POST are both unsafe methods. However, PUT is idempotent, while POST is not.</li>
</ul>
</p>
