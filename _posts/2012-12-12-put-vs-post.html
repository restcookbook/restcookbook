<p class="question">When should we use PUT and when should we use POST?</p>

<p>The HTTP methods POST and PUT aren't the HTTP equivalent of the CRUD's create and update. The both serve a
    different purpose. It's quite possible, valid and even preferred in some occasions, to use PUT to create resources,
    or use POST to update resources.</p>

<p>Use PUT when you can update a resource completely through a specific resource. For instance, if you know that an
    article resides at http://example.org/article/1234, you can PUT a new resource representation of this article
    directly through a PUT on this URL.</p>

<p>If you do not know the actual resource location, for instance, when you add a new article, but do not have any idea
    where to store it, you can POST it to an URL, and let the server decide the actual URL.</p>

{% highlight xml %}
PUT /article/1234 HTTP/1.1
<article>
    <title>red stapler</title>
    <price currency="eur">12.50</price>
</article>
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight xml %}
POST /articles HTTP/1.1
<article>
    <title>blue stapler</title>
    <price currency="eur">7.50</price>
</article>

HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: /articles/63636
{% endhighlight %}

<p>As soon as you know the new resource location, you can use PUT again to do updates to the blue stapler article. But
    as said before: you CAN add new resources through PUT as well. The next example is perfectly valid if your API
    provides this functionality:</p>

{% highlight xml %}
PUT /articles/green-stapler HTTP/1.1
<article>
    <title>green stapler</title>
    <price currency="eur">9.95</price>
</article>

HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: /articles/green-stapler
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Here, the client decided on the actual resource URL.</p>



<h3>Caveats</h3>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>PUT and POST are both unsafe methods. However, PUT is idempotent, while POST is not.</li>
</ul>
</p>
